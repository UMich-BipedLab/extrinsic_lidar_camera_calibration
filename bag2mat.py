[HOW TO USE]
To run this file, please change the path in main function and change topics names if
you have other topics you would like to extract.

If you have all patches extracted, please set extracted = 1, then it will only convert
the bagfiles to mat-files. (extracting the whole pcl to mat)

If you have not extracted patches from /lidar/point_cloud, please set extracted = 0,
and specify a cuboid in the readPointsAndSave function.

If you have all the extracted files in a folder, please set load_folder = 1, it will
go ahead convert all the files to mat-files; please also remember to set the topic
names.

Please run this by:
    python bag2mat.py [bagfile.bag] [event-name]
    [bagfile.bag]: name of the bagfile
    [event-name]: whatever you would like to name you want to include in the output file name
